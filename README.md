Read Me file for my Final Project for Ampli.

My project includes 5 Pages.
- For 2 of them, I used API.

First of them, is Rick and Morty page. There I was using Rick and Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/api). I made a page with all characters that were in Cartoon.

Second of them, is Film page. Where you can find huge library of films. I used (http://www.omdbapi.com/).
Where by writing one word from title your film, you can find not only that one, which was you looking for, but also some other, incudes this word in their titles.

I want to tell you about me home  page. I made ticket searching menu, where you can write you data, and search you flights on official site of "SkyScanner".
